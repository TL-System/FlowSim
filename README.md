Flow-level-Network-Simulator
============================

This is an event based flow-level network simulator. It is written in Python for fast prototype implementation.
It is memory consumed since data structure in python is always crazy...
OK, it is because python is an intepretation language, the translation from virtual machine to machine code is without controlling.

Overall, this is a prototype just for fast implementation to correct all the fuctions we need. 

I will later rewrite the simulator by C++ to improve the performance.
